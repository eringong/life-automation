A bunch of (mostly) selenium-powered scripts to automate small life tasks.

# Renew Books
Renews library books from my local library.

# Auto Shopper

Fills Instacart shopping cart with items in your lists. Lists must be created first in Instacart and then list names and id numbers hard coded in script (hard coding is partly due to inconsistencies and errors in the Instacart UI). Pass in list names and the script will add all items from the lists to your cart. Works for lists with items from multiple stores.
